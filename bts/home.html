        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the
          Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that was formed
          in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The
          septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and
          Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.
          Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include
          a wide range of genres.

        <h3>Formation and early years</h3>
        <p>
          BTS began its forprmation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang
          Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.
          The lineup was finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and
          Jungkook in 2012 when Jin, the oldest member of the group, was
          twenty-years-old. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain
          attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well
          as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.

        <h3>Mainstream and international breakthrough</h3>
        <p>
          In November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the
          American Music Awards, raising their profile internationally. That
          same month, Guinness World Records revealed that BTS had earned a spot
          in their 2018 edition for "having the world's most Twitter engagements
          for a music group". In December, they also became the first K-pop
          group to perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to welcome the
          new year and made their Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi's
          Japan Music Station Super Live.

        <h3>Cultural Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Billboard's Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS
          are comparable to and as influential as the Beatles and the Monkees.
          Nielsen Music Vice President Helena Kosinski said that "although BTS
          weren't the first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the
          first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but
          also to the 50s and 60s age demographic." As the first non-English
          speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the
          second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second
          best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and
          streaming platforms, coming second only to Drake.
